This repository contains a compiled version of my projects that were completed in a span of 5 months while taking the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera taught by Andrew Ng

## Thoughts
This course presents the most current material on deep learning today. Although, there are many other algorithms, lessons, research, and ways that deep learning is being studied, this course does a fantastic job of offering material that is relevant and can be implememnted with support from many projects in the DL community. This course uses the commong frameworks like [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and [Keras](https://keras.io) and uses Python libraries such as Numpy and SciPy.
