# Deep Learning Specialization by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org)

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org)

This repository contains a compiled version of my projects that were completed in a span of 5 months while taking the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera taught by Andrew Ng

## Thoughts
This course presents the most current material on deep learning today. Although, there are many other algorithms, lessons, research, and ways that deep learning is being studied, this course does a fantastic job of offering material that is relevant and can be implememnted with support from many projects in the DL community. This course uses the commong frameworks like [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and [Keras](https://keras.io) and uses Python libraries such as Numpy and SciPy. 
Obviously, learning dense material like this from a MOOC platform is different from an academic setting like personal time with a professor or instructor, instructor quality, and lesson quality. This specialization in particular is taught by a top AI reseracher in the world who has real industry expereince in applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning applications. 
The material was presented in a way that is relatively basic and easy to understand while honing in on the complexity of the algorithms and how the concepts are applied to solve real world problems. Generally, this course covers real world applications like computer vision, natural language processing, voice detection and facial recognition.

This course is part of my continuing study of Deep Learning and AI.
